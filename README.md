# web-model 

API layer for the web, organize your api requests nicely.

Instead of repeating api requests everywhere in your SPA, a maintainable model layer for backend's api service seems more reasonable. 
Web-model has many useful features: request/response guards, request caching(web storage), singleton request, and more to come.
Web-model rely [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent) as ajax tool.
